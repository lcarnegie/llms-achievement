This study underscores the prevalence of AI in academic settings and suggests pedagogical practices to integrate AI in the classroom in ways that are informed by students' current interactions with and attitudes toward AI. Using a survey of undergraduate students in political science courses, the study finds that ChatGPT usage is widespread at the university level and that students are not confident in their skills for using AI appropriately to improve their writing or prepare for exams. These findings point to key areas where instructors can intervene and integrate AI in ways that enhance student learning, reduce potential achievement gaps that may emerge due to differences in AI usage across student backgrounds, and help students develop critical AI literacy skills to prepare for careers that increasingly are affected by AI.},

AI) paradigm that aims at broadening participation in data science education and enhancing undergraduate students' data literacy. The core of the paradigm is the ``Tell Stories'' approach. This approach applies the 5W+1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) conceptual schema of stories as a transdisciplinary language for data science education for STEM and non-STEM majors. Accordingly, this study reported findings from the OCEL.AI project that implemented and evaluated the paradigm. A field experiment, in addition to classroom observations, was conducted to compare the learning outcomes of students in data science competence, appreciation, career motivation, life-long willingness to learn, and self-efficacy in data science between the treatment group and the control group. The results showed that the OCEL.AI paradigm improved undergraduates' data science competence and career motivation despite majors or gender.},

	abstractnote = {Artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies are transforming many consumption activities, powering breakthroughs that expand the human experience by enhancing human capabilities, performance, and creativity. While this explains the consumer enthusiasm and rapid adoption of these technologies, AI systems can also have the opposite effect: reducing and constraining the range of experiences that are available to consumers. This article examines the mechanisms through which AI can constrain the human experience, considering individual, interpersonal, and societal processes. Our analysis uncovers a complex interplay between the advantages of AI and its inadvertent negative repercussions, which potentially restrict human autonomy, self-identity, relational dynamics, and social behavior. In this article, we propose three different mechanisms at the core of these constraining forces: parametric reductionism, agency transference, and regulated expression. Our exploration of these mechanisms highlights the risks connected to system design and points to questions and implications for future researchers and policymakers.},
